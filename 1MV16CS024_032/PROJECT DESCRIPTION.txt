DESCRIPTION:
            
		The objective of this DBMS project is to design and develop an airline reservation system. The primary 
		function would be to enable a customer to book airline tickets.
            
                It will allow the customer to make bookings/search for flights through different ways such as by 
		choosing convenient source and destination places or by favourable dates. It shall also enable the user 
		to modify his/her bookings.
            
                This system will be a real time system, and the pricing of the tickets will vary with time. Each new 
		customer will be required to make a login account with their details, which enables them to reach the
		booking stage. The same account can be used again for future bookings.
