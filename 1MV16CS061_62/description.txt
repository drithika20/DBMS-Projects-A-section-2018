DESCRIPTION:
The scope of the project is clear to give a simple and attractive application to simplify the work as well as to reduce the efforts while doing it offline
 or we can say by doing it with old methods.
In this application we are able to save the database of all the staff, animals need and tourist data.
The staff data includes the staff profession and their salary details, the animal data includes the type of animal (either herbivore or carnivore)
 and their feed cost, tourist data includes the ticket details and the donations they make.
