A Database created to manage the Latest hackathons happening in and around the country.
This Database contains various entities and relationships as decribed in the attached ER_diagram.
It manages the complete details of the hackathon such as the venues , sponsors , winners , etc.. and the applicants who have RSVP'D for it.

REASON FOR DEVELOPMENT:

Most Hackathons are organised and promoted through individual Websites and so intrested participants 
have no access to any sort of portal to keep track or retrieve data pertaining to all te hackathons being conducted.

Hence this DBMS project will eliminate this ambiguity amongst the applicants and serve them the purpose.

Also the sponsors can keep track of the number of hackathons they have sponsored and pick the best Talents from the crowd.
